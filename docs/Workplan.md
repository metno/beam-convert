Summer melt associated uncertainty estimation
---------------------------------------------

(Thats a working title up there)

 1. Data acquistion: Figure out which time range and time scale (instanteneous, daily, monthly) is available for each of the following data sources
  1. PMW (products based on SSM/I, AMSR2, SMMR)
   1. OSI SAF
   1. IUP
   1. NSIDC
  1. Optical
    1. AVHRR L1B, probably from CLASS archive 
 1. Data processing
  1. Start with proof of concept for a limited time range (e.g. one week/month/year)
  1. Extend the processing for the entire time range
 1. Analysis and report
  1. Make a first draft
  1. Internal review


1. Make a case study/comparison between swath and gridded daily based sic.
 1. Get a month of AMSR-2 swath and gridded data, and a month of CLASS noaa L1b information.
 1. The area of interest:
  1. UL: 73 10 50.572 N and 83 55 51.534 W (73.180714N and 83.9309816W)
  1. LR: 53 45 33.028 N and 38 47 58.682 E (53.759174N and 38.7996338E)
  1. UR: 66 46 32.424 N and 85 38 11.481 E (66.775673N and 85.6365225E)
  1. LL: 57 11 35.748 N and 29 59 08.321 W (57.193263N and 29.9856447W)
 1. Time of interest: August 2013

 * Report to be submitted before December 2016.
 * November 2014, Barcelona, status present to be presented.


 Ice service -- cover couple of days

 Dates:
  * Some time next week -- ice service training
  

  Case study: Daily vs Swath based

  1. Get Amsr2 swath listing + data
  1. Get AVHRR L1B swath listing + data
  1. Get the number of concurrent observations + data
  1. Get Amsr2 gridded daily L3 obsevations
  1. Process L1B avhrr data, produce SIC observations
  1. Perform comparison between Amsr2 swath and AVHRR data
  1. Perform comparison between Amsr2 grids and AVHRR swath
  1. Perform comparison between Amsr2 grids and AVHRR grids

Write Abstract for Barcelona meeting (do it far in advance)
