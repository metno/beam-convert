DONE: Implemented beampy AVHRR reader and behaviour tests.
      Source beam.env file before running the test suite.
DONE: implemented an AVHRR converter program

DONE: request AVHRR data (LAC/GAC/FRAC?)

TODO: do a quick analysis of different resolutions, 1km vs 4km, how much of information is being lost?
TODO: define area of interest, create Pyresample areas.cfg file
TODO: download AMSR2 data

Update:
 * three projects
   -- compare the spatial resolution effects (lac vs gac vs 10k?)
   -- compare the temporal resolution effect (swath vs daily)
   -- get GAC data records

Model evaluation statistics
---------------------------
Gathered a set of statistical measures to analyze the experiments

ICE-ARC report
